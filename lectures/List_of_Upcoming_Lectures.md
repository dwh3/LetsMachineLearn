# List of Upcoming Lectures


* Basics of GitHub
  * Cloning repos
  * Adding
  * Pushing
  * Etc.

* Data
  * Visualizing data structures 
    * (databases, data warehouses, data lakes, etc.)
    * Have examples online and offline (SQLite and Google services, etc.)

* Online resources
  * "Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services for the Hobbyist" on Medium.
  * AWS Free tier
    * [https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier=&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all](Can sign up here.)
    * There are tutorials, etc. here.  
  * Things you can do on each (in lecture notes, note what is done in what and what alternatives are)
