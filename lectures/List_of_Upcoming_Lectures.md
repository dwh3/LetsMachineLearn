# List of Upcoming Lectures



* Data
  * Visualizing data structures 
    * (databases, data warehouses, data lakes, etc.)
    * Have examples online and offline (SQLite and Google services, etc.)

* Online resources
  * "Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services for the Hobbyist" on Medium.
