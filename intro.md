# Lets Machine Learn


This is a webpage/book to document my learning process into Economics, ML, and general CS topics. I am posting it for all to see, in case it helps anyone else learn also. This website was created using Jupyter Books ([documentation for that can be found here](https://jupyterbook.org)), in conjunction with GitHub pages.
